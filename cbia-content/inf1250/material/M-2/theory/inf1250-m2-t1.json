  "body": "An algorithm is a finite, deterministic procedure that transforms well-defined inputs into outputs in order to solve a problem. The first step is not writing steps, but clarifying the problem through a specification. A specification states what the algorithm must accomplish, which inputs are valid, which outputs are expected, and which constraints apply. Only once this is stable does algorithm design begin.\n\nProblem decomposition breaks a complex task into smaller sub-problems that can be solved independently. Each sub-problem should have a clear responsibility and a simple interface. This reduces cognitive load and allows reasoning about correctness one piece at a time. Decomposition also exposes assumptions early, such as hidden constraints or edge cases, which can otherwise invalidate a solution late in development.\n\nAlgorithms must satisfy three essential properties. They must terminate, meaning they complete after a finite number of steps. They must be unambiguous, so that each step is precisely defined and executable. Finally, they must be effective, meaning that each step can in principle be carried out using basic operations. In INF1250, determinism is emphasized because predictable behavior simplifies verification and grading.\n\nCommon errors include mixing specification with implementation details, skipping edge cases, or decomposing along unclear boundaries. A good algorithm description can be checked for completeness without running any code.",
