  "body": "Data represents information manipulated by an algorithm, while state refers to the collection of data values at a given moment. Computation can be viewed as a sequence of state transitions, where each operation transforms one state into the next. Making these transitions explicit is key to understanding and verifying algorithm behavior.\n\nVariables name data values, and types conceptually restrict which values and operations are valid. Even without formal type systems, reasoning about what kind of data a variable holds prevents many errors. Inputs initialize state, derived values are computed from existing state, and persistent state remains relevant across multiple steps.\n\nMutability determines whether state is modified in place or replaced with new values. While INF1250 does not require deep language-specific treatment, it is important to track where and when data changes. Bugs often arise when state is shared across multiple parts of an algorithm without clear ownership.\n\nA disciplined approach identifies all state variables, specifies which operations may change them, and avoids unnecessary coupling. This makes algorithm behavior predictable and easier to reason about.",
