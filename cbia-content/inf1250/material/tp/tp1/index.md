# INF1250 — TP1 (Module 2)

## Authority (source of truth)
- **Feuille de route (TELUQ)** is the control document for scope, sequencing, and assessment framing.
- The **TP1 statement** referenced by the feuille de route is the authoritative specification for:
  - what must be answered
  - formatting / submission constraints
  - marking expectations

CBIA rule: this block does **not** introduce new theory; it only provides execution scaffolding.

## Scope
- **Assessed block:** Module 2 (Concepts BD, modèle relationnel, SGBD)
- **Deliverable:** TP1
- **Weight:** 15%

Module 1 content is vocabulary/orientation and may be used only to normalize terms.

## Required submission constraints (as enforced by CBIA scaffolding)
- One submission artifact: **PDF/DOC/DOCX** (single document)
- **Not** a ZIP archive
- Answers must be **clearly numbered** and **in order**
- Include any assumptions explicitly when the TP statement requires interpretation

## CBIA outputs for TP1
- `tp1-answer-template.md`  
  Deterministic answer skeleton (Q1..Qn) matching the TP statement structure.
- `tp1-checklist-cbia.md`  
  Pre-submit checklist (format gates + completeness gates + logic gates).

## Working method (recommended)
1. Read TP1 statement once end-to-end; extract the question tree (Q1/Q2/Q3…).
2. Fill the **template headings first** (no content) to lock structure.
3. Solve each question using the smallest correct derivation; avoid extra prose unless required.
4. Run the checklist before export to PDF/DOCX.

## Status
- Scaffold stage: **index created**
- Next: generate `tp1-answer-template.md`, then `tp1-checklist-cbia.md`.
